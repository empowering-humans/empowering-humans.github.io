        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Assistive agents should make humans' lives easier. Classically, such assistance is studied through the lens of
          inverse reinforcement learning, where an assistive agent (e.g., a chatbot, a robot) infers a human's intention
          and then selects actions to help the human reach that goal. This approach requires inferring intentions, which
          can be difficult in high-dimensional settings. We build upon prior work that studies assistance through the
          lens of empowerment: an assistive agent aims to maximize the influence of the human's actions such that they
          exert a greater control over the environmental outcomes and can solve tasks in fewer steps. We lift the major
          limitation of prior work in this area---scalability to high-dimensional settings---with contrastive successor
          representations. We formally prove that these representations estimate a similar notion of empowerment to that
          studied by prior work and provide a ready-made mechanism for optimizing it. Empirically, our proposed method
          outperforms prior methods on synthetic benchmarks, and scales to Overcooked, a cooperative game setting.
          Theoretically, our work connects ideas from information theory, neuroscience, and reinforcement learning, and
          charts a path for representations to play a critical role in solving assistive problems.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Method: Empowerment via Successor Representations</h2>
        <p>
          Our core contribution is a novel objective for training agents that are intrinsically motivated to assist
          humans without requiring a model of the human's reward function. Our objective,
          <b>Empowerment via Successor Representations (ESR)</b>, maximizes the influence of the human's actions on the
          environment, and, unlike past approaches for assistance without reward inference, is based on a scalable
          model-free objective that can be derived from learned successor features that encode which states the human is
          likely to want to reach given their current action. Our objective empowers the human to reach the desired
          states, not all states, without assuming a human model.
        </p>
        <p>Our method learns three representations:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            $\phi(s,\ar,\ah)$ -- This representation can be understood as a sort of latent-space model, predicting the
            future representation given the current state $s$ and the human's current action $\ah$ as well as the
            robot's current action $\ar$.
          </li>
          <li>
            $\phi'(s,\ar)$ -- This representation can be understood as an uncontrolled model, predicting the
            representation of a future state without reference to the current human action $\ah$. This representation is
            analogous to a value function.
          </li>
          <li>$\psi(s^+)$ -- This is a representation of a future state.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We then use these learned representations to compute the approximate empowerment reward:</p>
        $$r(s, \ar) = \bigl(\phi(s_t, \ar, \ah) - \phi(s_t, \ar)\bigr)^T \psi(g)$$
        <p>which we use to train an assistive policy <em>without estimating the human's reward.</em></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Analyzing the Empowerment Objective</h2>
        <p>
          The key insight behind the ESR algorithm is that by maximizing a notion of human empowerment in the
          environment, we avoid needing to infer the human's objectives (or know them in advance).

          <p>(b) Mutual information</p>
          <p>(c) Maximizing empowerment</p>
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          <b>The Information Geometry of Empowerment.</b> <em>(Left)</em> For a given state $s_t$ and assistant policy
          $\pir$, we plot the distribution over future states for 6 choices of the human policy $\pih$. In a 3-state
          MDP, we can represent each policy as a vector lying on the 2-dimensional probability simplex. We refer to the
          set of all possible state distributions as the <em>state marginal polytope</em>. <em>(Center)</em> Mutual
          information corresponds to the distance between the center of the polytope and the vertices that are maximally
          far away. <em>(Right)</em> Empowerment corresponds to maximizing the size of this polytope. For example, when
          an assistive agent moves an obstacle out of a human user's way, the human user can spend more time at desired
          state.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the special case where the human is maximizing a family of reward functions for different skills, we show
          that empowerment enables optimal assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Lemma 3.</b>
          Assume that a human has learned skills $\pi(a \mid s, z)$ by maximizing mutual information $I(\sfut; z)$ and
          adapts to a reward function by minimizing the regularized regret: $$\begin{align} \min_{\rho^* \in
          \mathcal{C}^{\pir}} \max_{\rho^+ \in \mathcal{C}} \E_{\rho^+(s)}[r(s)] - \E_{\rho^*(s)}[r(s)] +
          D_\text{KL}\bigl(\rho^*(s) \| \rho(s)\bigr). \end{align}$$ We assume that the human chooses the prior
          $\rho(s)$ that minimizes this regret for the worst-case choice of reward function (i.e., the minimax optimal
          prior). An assistive agent that maximizes $I^{\pir}(\sfut; z)$ minimizes the worst-case (regularized) regret
          incurred by the human. Letting $\pir^* \in \arg\max_{\pir} I^{\pir}(\sfut; z)$, we have \begin{align} \pir^*
          \in \arg\min_{\pir} \biggl(\min_{\rho(s) \in \mathcal{C}^{\pir}} \max_{r(s)} \min_{\rho^* \in
          \mathcal{C}^{\pir}} \max_{\rho^+ \in \mathcal{C}^{\pir}} \E_{\rho^+(s)}[r(s)] - \E_{\rho^*(s)}[r(s)] +
          D_\text{KL}(\rho^*(s) \| \rho(s)) \biggr). \end{align}

        <p class="caption">
          <b>Visualizing Training Empowerment</b> in a 5x5 Gridworld with 10 obstacles. The human gets reward from
          reaching a goal square. The assistive agent can move the obstacles to open up a path to the goal. Our method
          learns to maximize the mutual information between the human's action and their future state conditioned on
          their current state. This corresponds to maximizing the volume of the state marginal polytope, which is
          proportional to the number of states that the human can reach from their current position. To visualize the
          representations, we set the latent dimension to 3 instead of 100.
